# Step-by-Step MLXEngine Implementation Guide (2024 Edition)

## üéØ Practical Implementation: Building for All Model Types and Real-World Use

This guide now covers the full implementation of MLXEngine, supporting LLM, VLM, Embedding, and Diffusion models, with robust HuggingFace API integration, device-aware model selection, feature flags, and comprehensive real-model testing.

---

## üì¶ Step 1: Project Setup
- Create the package structure and declare dependencies on MLX, MLXLLM, MLXLMCommon, MLXVLM, MLXEmbedders, StableDiffusion
- Ensure SPM/Xcode compatibility

---

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Core Foundation
- Define `ModelConfiguration`, `GenerateParams`, and `LLMEngine` protocol
- Establish error types and platform detection
- Add feature flag enum for extensibility

---

## üß† Step 3: Engine & Registry
- Implement `InferenceEngine` with unified MLX/mock fallback
- Build out `ModelRegistry` with all major model types:
  - LLM (Qwen, Llama, Phi, Mistral, etc.)
  - VLM (LLaVA, etc.)
  - Embedding (BGE, etc.)
  - Diffusion (Stable Diffusion, SDXL Turbo, etc.)
- Add search, filter, and recommendation APIs

---

## üåê Step 4: Model Download & Device Awareness
- Integrate HuggingFace API for model search/download
- Implement device-aware model selection (optimize for RAM, GPU, etc.)
- Ensure all downloads are resumable and validated

---

## ‚ö° Step 5: MLX Integration & Advanced Features
- Integrate MLX, MLXLLM, MLXLMCommon, MLXVLM, MLXEmbedders, StableDiffusion
- Add support for quantization, LoRA, multi-modal, and custom tokenizers via feature flags
- Implement streaming, batch, and multi-modal inference

---

## üìä Step 6: Performance, Monitoring, and Error Recovery
- Add performance metrics, health checks, and diagnostics
- Implement retry logic, error recovery, and memory management

---

## üß™ Step 7: Comprehensive Testing & Documentation
- All unit/integration tests must download and run real models from HuggingFace
- Tests must cover all model types and features (LLM, VLM, Embedding, Diffusion, quantization, etc.)
- Document all APIs, usage, and extension points
