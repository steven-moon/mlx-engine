# UIAI: Shared SwiftUI Component Library for MLXEngine

---

## Vision & Goals

UIAI is a cross-platform SwiftUI component library designed to accelerate the development of AI-powered apps using MLXEngine. It provides a suite of flexible, composable, and modern UI elements for model discovery, management, chat, and diagnosticsâ€”enabling developers to build robust AI experiences for iOS, macOS, visionOS, tvOS, and watchOS with minimal effort.

**Key Goals:**
- **Plug-and-play:** Components are drop-in and require minimal setup.
- **Cross-platform:** Designed for all Apple platforms (and extensible to others).
- **AI-native:** Tailored for LLM, VLM, and embedding workflows.
- **Customizable:** Style and behavior can be adapted to app needs.
- **Composable:** Components can be combined or used standalone.
- **Open & Extensible:** Encourage community contributions and custom extensions.

## Component Catalog

### 1. Model Discovery & Management

- **ModelDiscoveryView**
  - Search Hugging Face and local registry for compatible models.
  - Filter by architecture, quantization, size, or capability.
  - Show model cards with metadata, download status, and quick actions.
  - Suggest models based on device RAM, platform, and user needs.

- **ModelDetailView**
  - Show full model metadata, download progress, and usage instructions.
  - Allow download, update, or delete actions.
  - Show compatibility warnings (e.g., too large for device).

- **ModelDownloadManagerView**
  - List all downloaded models, with status and management actions.
  - Show disk usage and cache controls.

- **ModelSuggestionBanner**
  - Inline suggestions for best-fit models based on device and context.

### 2. Chat & Conversation

- **ChatView**
  - Modern, streaming chat interface with support for LLMs.
  - Supports markdown, code, and rich content rendering.
  - Handles streaming tokens, user/assistant roles, and error states.

- **ChatInputView**
  - Multi-line, expandable input with send/stop controls.
  - Supports system prompts, temperature, and other generation params.

- **ChatHistoryView**
  - List of past chat sessions, with search and filtering.
  - Export, delete, or resume previous sessions.

- **ChatSessionManager**
  - Manage multiple concurrent chat sessions.
  - Save/restore state across app launches.

### 3. Diagnostics & Developer Tools

- **DebugPanel**
  - In-app diagnostics: logs, debug reports, and health checks.
  - Log level filtering, copy/share diagnostics, and system info.

- **ModelHealthIndicator**
  - Visual indicator of model/engine health (e.g., GPU, memory, download status).

- **ErrorBanner**
  - Inline error and warning display for user-facing issues.

### 4. Utilities & Building Blocks

- **AsyncImageView**
  - For model cards, avatars, and image-based models.

- **TokenProgressBar**
  - Visualize streaming token generation or download progress.

- **SettingsPanel**
  - Unified settings for model, generation, and app preferences.

- **PlatformAdaptiveView**
  - Adapts layout and controls for iOS, macOS, visionOS, tvOS, and watchOS.

## Design Philosophy & Best Practices

- **SwiftUI-first:** All components use idiomatic SwiftUI, leveraging modern patterns (e.g., `Observable`, `@StateObject`, `@Environment`).
- **Accessibility:** All UI elements are accessible and support dynamic type, VoiceOver, and platform conventions.
- **Theming:** Support for light/dark mode and custom color schemes.
- **Performance:** Efficient rendering for large chat histories and model lists.
- **Extensibility:** Developers can provide custom views, actions, and data sources.
- **Documentation:** Each component includes usage examples and integration notes.

## Example Usage

```swift
import UIAI

struct MyAppView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            ModelDiscoveryView()
        }
    }
}
```

## Roadmap & Community

- **Initial Release:** Core model discovery, chat, and diagnostics components.
- **Platform Expansion:** Optimize for visionOS, tvOS, and watchOS.
- **Community Contributions:** Encourage PRs for new widgets, themes, and integrations.
- **Integration Guides:** Provide recipes for common app types (chatbot, embedder, VLM, etc.).
